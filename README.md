# Project Motivation
Due to the current global circumstances, I believed that taking the "CoronaVirus" issue into consideration is a duty, and that people should know the seriousness of the current situation in order to take the necessary measures, so I wanted to discuss these questions:<br>
1.How does the virus spread ?<br>
2.What is the virus's death rate ?<br>
3.What is the virus's recovered rate ?<br>
4.How to protect our selves and people we love ?<br>

# File Descriptions
This is a file about the "COCID-19 pandemic and some data analysis of the existing dataset and some introductions on how to stay safe.
